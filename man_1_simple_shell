.SH NAME
.B hsh
- Command line interpreter (shell)
.SH SYNOPSIS
The shell is executed by typing ./hsh
.br
Then, it will wait for an input such as : command [arguments] [other]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This shell is a project dedicated to our studies. My partner and I, have tried to mimic the behavior of a real shell. In case you don't know what a shell is (I doubt that) here is a brief explanation. A shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. Our shell does not support the arguments passed to it, yet. We are still working on it.
.br
.B What hsh can do :
.br
- Executes any command with its arguments
.br
- Executes built-in commands
.br
- Handle pipes
.br
- Handle the command seperator ;
.br
- Handle && and || logical operators
.br
- handle variable replacement
.br
- handle the $? variable
.br
- handle the $$ variable
.SH BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS
Those are the available built-in functions :
.br
 - exit : exit the shell
.br
